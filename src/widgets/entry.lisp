  "Renders the entry to the output stream.

Could be part of the render pipeline of an entry widger,
or used raw.


The optional account does some tricky filtering:

1. It will show the entry if at least one of the transactions involve account.
2. It will not show the transactions for account.

What it will show:

- Funds column:   The virtual entry that is NOT a special entry
- Target:         The non-virtual entry that is not equal to account
